# ventilation

This project aim is to create ventilation system that requires almost zero end-user interaction, using CO2 level as trigger.
I'm using two Blauberg Vento systems - protocol is here:

for ventilation
Winsen MH-Z19b - for monitoring CO2 level
and (currently) Orange Pi Zero Plus2 for putting things together.

Tested for almost two years now, everything works good.
